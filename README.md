# Background:

SynergizerAI was a Proof of Concept (POC) app aimed at helping Business Developers and Business Development Managers achieve their full potential by automating the partnership discovery process and management (think of it as a CRM of sorts), where, for example, said users can discover potential partnering companies to enter a partnership with and generate partnership decks (slideshows) to present, as well as refining how a partnership deal would look like between two companies. Since this is a POC, ready to use LLMs such as GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 were used with additional Fine Tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to help generate the partnership and any additional info. 

On the frontend, React with Vite was used, with additional libraries such as react-router-dom and MaterialUI for ready to use components as well as TailwindCSS for quick styling and quick iteration. It also uses the Firebase SDK for user authentication & login using SSO such as Google.

Whilst the app itself is no longer maintained (and the backend is no longer functional), the front end remains for archiving with a demo of how it worked below using a dummy user:
